PROGRAM:RandomSample

Randomly returns integers from an int[ ]. Returns an array 1/2 the size of the original. 
Sorts new array from least to greatest. 

INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Input a list of integers between the " { } " in line 4:

  int[] list = { };
  
2. Automatically sets new array length to 1/2 the size of the original array. You can modify 
to any size array by modifying line 5:

  int numbers = list.length/2;
  
Change "list.length/2" to the number that reflects desired length of new array. 

3. Recompile code, and run:

  void main(String[] args)
